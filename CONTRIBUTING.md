# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for contributing to the Transit Tracker project! If you are considering opening a PR, please take a quick look through these guidelines to help you get started.

## Discuss Your Changes

If you are implementing a feature which has a wide scope or significant changes, please first open an issue to discuss the proposed changes with the maintainers. This helps ensure that your efforts align with the project's goals and avoids duplicate work.

## Write Tests

It's important to write tests for your changes to ensure maintainability as the project evolves. Please add relevant unit tests in `test/unit` and, if you are making changes to the GTFS feed provider, the E2E tests in `test/e2e`.

## AI/LLM Usage

If you use a generative AI tool (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude Code, etc.) in any part of your contribution process, please disclose this in your PR description. This helps maintain transparency and allows us to understand the context of your changes better.
